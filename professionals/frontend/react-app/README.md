## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Vite React boilerplate repository to your local machine using Git. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your project repository.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: Change your working directory to the project folder.

    ```bash
    cd HactoberFest-23/professionals/frontend/react-app
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Development Server

### Starting the Development Server

4. **Start the Development Server**: Run the development server, which provides live reloading and fast development.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This command will start the development server, and you can access your app in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contributing to the Project

5. **Make Changes**: Now that your development server is running, you can start making changes to the project. Edit the React components, styles, or any other files as needed.

6. **Create a New Branch**: Before you make any changes, it's a good practice to create a new Git branch for your feature or bug fix.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```

    Replace `feature-name` with a descriptive name for your branch.

7. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them with a meaningful commit message.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    ```

8. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature-name
    ```

    Replace `feature-name` with the name of your branch.

9. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the GitHub repository of the original project and create a new pull request from your branch. Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.

10. **Review and Collaborate**: Collaborate with other contributors and project maintainers by discussing your changes, making improvements, and addressing feedback in the PR conversation.

11. **Merge Your Changes**: Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they can be merged into the main branch of the project.

12. **Cleanup**: After your changes have been merged, you can delete your feature branch if it's no longer needed.

    ```bash
    git branch -d feature-name
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git branch -D feature-name
    ```

    (Use `-D` to force delete the branch)

That's it! You've successfully set up a Vite React project, started the development server, and contributed to the project by making and submitting changes. Remember to follow the project's contribution guidelines and coding standards while working on your contributions.
