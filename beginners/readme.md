## index.html

**File Name**: `index.html`

This file contains the HTML code for the website. It serves as the foundation of the web page. As a beginner, you can modify, enhance, or fix the code within this file. Feel free to experiment and make changes to improve the web page's functionality or appearance.

## styles.css

**File Name**: `styles.css`

The `styles.css` file is responsible for defining the visual styles of the HTML page. Beginners can contribute by enhancing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the website. You can adjust the colors, fonts, layout, and other styling elements to make the page more appealing and user-friendly.

## script.js

**File Name**: `script.js`

To include any JavaScript functionality on the web page, create a file named `script.js` and link it to the `index.html` file. As a beginner, you can add interactive features, perform form validations, or implement other client-side scripting. Don't forget to test your JavaScript code to ensure it works as expected.

## assets/

**Folder Name**: `assets/`

The `assets/` folder is where you can store images, fonts, or any other additional assets needed for your contributions. If you want to add images to the website, create a subfolder within `assets/` and place your images there. Remember to reference these assets correctly in your HTML and CSS files.

Contributing as a beginner is a great way to learn and gain experience. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from experienced contributors if you encounter any challenges. Your contributions, no matter how small, are valuable to the project, and your learning journey begins here. Happy coding!
